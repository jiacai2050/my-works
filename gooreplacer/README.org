对于只想重定向谷歌资源的用户，可以直接使用下面的规则，目前会重定向到 [[https://u.sb/css-cdn/][loli.net]] 的代理。

#+begin_src
||ajax.googleapis.com/,wildcard,redirect
transform:host=ajax.loli.net

||fonts.googleapis.com/,wildcard,redirect
transform:host=fonts.loli.net

||fonts.gstatic.com/,wildcard,redirect
transform:host=gstatic.loli.net

||secure.gravatar.com/,wildcard,redirect
transform:host=gravatar.loli.net

||www.google.com/recaptcha/,wildcard,redirect
transform:host=recaptcha.net
#+end_src

也欢迎大家在[[https://github.com/jiacai2050/my-works/discussions/7][这里]]分享自己使用的规则，以应对各种棘手情况，提供更好地互联网冲浪体验。🚀

* Rules
#+begin_example
[filter][filter_type][action]
[action_options]
#+end_example
- Empty lines or lines start with =#= act as rule delimiter.
- =[filter]= acting on URLs under a specified domain.
- =[filter_type]=, available values: =wildcard= or =regex=
- =[action]=, available values: =block= or =redirect= or =modifyHeaders=
- =[action_options]=
  - For =redirect=, it's redirected url, it can be
    - =url:url= Static redirected url
    - =regexSubstitution:url= Dynamic redirected URL, see regex filter docs below for example.
    - ~transform:k1=v1;k2=v2~ Transform part of a URL, see [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#type-URLTransform][URLTransform]] for valid values. Frequently used properties are: =host=, =path=, =query=, =scheme=.
  - For =modifyHeaders=, it's headers to modify, format =[type][operation][header]=. This line can be repeated to modify multiple headers at once.
    - =type= can be =requestHeaders= or =responseHeaders=.
    - =operation= can be
      - =set=, Sets a new value for the specified header, removing any existing headers with the same name.
      - =append=, Adds a new entry for the specified header. This operation is not supported for request headers.
      - =remove=, Removes all entries for the specified header.
    - =header= has format like ~key=name~

* Filter Type
** Wildcard
The pattern which is matched against the network request url. Supported constructs:
- =*= :: Wildcard: Matches any number of characters.
- =|= :: Left/right anchor: If used at either end of the pattern, specifies the beginning/end of the url respectively.
- =||= :: Domain name anchor: If used at the beginning of the pattern, specifies the start of a (sub-)domain of the URL.
- =^= :: Separator character: This matches anything except a letter, a digit, or one of the following: =_=, =-=, =.=, or =%=. This also match the end of the URL.

Therefore =urlFilter= is composed of the following parts: (optional Left/Domain name anchor) + pattern + (optional Right anchor).

If omitted, all urls are matched. An empty string is not allowed.

| urlFilter         | Matches                                                                            | Does  not match                          |
|-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------|
| =abc=             | =https://abcd.com=, =https://example.com/abcd=                                     | =https://ab.com=                         |
| =abc*d=           | =https://abcd.com=, =https://example.com/abcxyzd=                                  | =https://abc.com=                        |
| =\vert{}\vert{}a.example.com= | =https://a.example.com/= =https://b.a.example.com/xyz= =https://a.example.company= | =https://example.com/=                   |
| =\vert{}https*=         | =https://example.com=                                                              | =http://example.com/= =http://https.com= |
| =example*^123\vert{}=   | =https://example.com/123= =http://abc.com/example?123=                             | =https://example.com/1234=               |

#+begin_quote
Note: The =urlFilter= must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8. For example, when the request url is =http://abc.рф?q=ф=, the urlFilter will be matched against the url =http://abc.xn--p1ai/?q=%D1%84=.

=\vert{}= above represents =|= , which is required in [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-symbols.html][org mode]].
#+end_quote
See [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#url_filter_syntax][URL filter syntax]] for more details.
** Regex
Regular expression to match against the network request url. This follows the [[https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax][RE2 syntax]].

The first match of =regexFilter= within the url will be replaced with this pattern. Within =regexSubstitution=, backslash-escaped digits (=\1= to =\9=) can be used to insert the corresponding capture groups. =\0= refers to the entire matching text.

#+begin_example
^https://www\\.(abc|def)\\.xyz\\.com/,regex,redirect
regexSubstitution:https://\\1.xyz.com/
#+end_example
This rule will redirect from =https://www.abc.xyz.com/path= to =https://abc.xyz.com/path=.

#+begin_quote
Note: The =regexFilter= must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8.
#+end_quote


* Write good URL conditions
Take care when writing rules to always match an entire domain. Otherwise, your rule may match in situations that are unexpected. For example, when using the pattern matching syntax:

- =google.com= incorrectly matches =https://example.com/?param=google.com=
- =||google.com= incorrectly matches =https://google.company=
- =https://www.google.com= incorrectly matches =https://example.com/?param=https://www.google.com=

Consider using:

- =||google.com/=, which matches all paths and all subdomains.
- =|https://www.google.com/= which matches all paths and no subdomains.

Similarly, use the =^= and =/= characters to anchor a regular expression. For example, =^https:\/\/www\.google\.com\/= matches any path on =https://www.google.com=.

* Header modification
According to [[https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest#header_modification][docs]], the append operation is only supported for the following headers:
- =accept=
- =accept-encoding=
- =accept-language=
- =access-control-request-headers=
- =cache-control=
- =connection=
- =content-language=
- =cookie=
- =forwarded=
- =if-match=
- =if-none-match=
- =keep-alive=
- =range=
- =te=
- =trailer=
- =transfer-encoding=
- =upgrade=
- =user-agent=
- =via=
- =want-digest=
- =x-forwarded-for=
